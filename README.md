# Stellar Agent Guard — Contracts

📚 **[Documentation](https://soroban-cost-estimator.gitbook.io/stellar-agent-guard-contracts/)**

**Non-custodial, account-level spending firewall for autonomous AI agents on Stellar.**

An autonomous agent holding a wallet has a single point of failure: one prompt-injection
or one buggy loop can drain it. Stellar Agent Guard makes that impossible on-chain — the
agent's funds stay in its own smart account, and *every* transaction the account must
authorize is intercepted by the contract's `__check_auth` and rejected pre-broadcast unless
it satisfies a policy the operator installed: per-transaction spend caps, a genuinely
rolling window cap, recipient/asset allowlists, a protocol/function allowlist, a pause
switch, and a dead-man switch (heartbeat with admin-attested reversal).

**Status: Phase 1 complete.** All five enforcement scenarios were proven against live
Stellar testnet (protocol 28) with real contract IDs and transaction hashes — evidence is
recorded in [`tests/fixtures/README.md`](tests/fixtures/README.md), and the deployed
contract's read functions were cross-checked live during this README pass (below).

The weekly [Futurenet host watch](.github/workflows/host-watch.yml) builds the contract, runs the
hermetic suite, then deploys a fresh ephemeral account to Futurenet and exercises
`initialize` → `set_policy` → an agent-signed `heartbeat` (the real `__check_auth` path) → read
`check`/`status` simulations. It also reports the Futurenet protocol version. This is intentionally
a compatibility signal, not a claim that Futurenet state is persistent; a failed run is visible
in Actions and is not silently opened as an issue. The host behaviors this watch covers are
listed in [SPEC §1.1](SPEC.md#11-sdk-and-host-surface-this-is-built-on-soroban-sdk-27).

## 🎯 What makes this different

Enforcement happens **inside the account itself**, via Soroban's native Custom Account
Abstraction — not in a wrapper contract in front of funds, not in an off-chain service.
The guard is a Soroban contract implementing the `CustomAccountInterface`; the agent's
Ed25519 public key is registered at `initialize`, and from then on the agent's address
*is* the contract's address. Any transaction that requires the agent's authorization is
routed by the host through `__check_auth`, which verifies the agent's signature over the
transaction auth payload and then evaluates the policy decision table over every auth
context. Funds never leave the agent's own account — there is no deposit step, no vault,
no `top_up`.

This is the mechanism the rest of the Soroban spend-guard ecosystem is converging on,
not a niche choice:

- [SpendGuard](https://github.com/deegalabs/stellar-402-spendguard) ("the spending-policy
  contract that was missing for x402 agents on Stellar") and
  [stellarspend-contracts](https://github.com/stellarspend/stellarspend-contracts)
  (automated budgets / spending limits) enforce limits around specific apps and payment
  rails, not at account-authorization time.
- [AgentGuard](https://github.com/Cowrie-Labs/agentguard) is a policy contract agents
  call into — a guard the agent must choose to route through, rather than the host
  intercepting every authorization.
- [Watchdog](https://github.com/leticarolina/watchdog) holds funds in a vault contract
  the agent never directly owns — custodial by design, with a one-time deposit step.
  Its own README names the smart-account model as the unbuilt future direction:
  > "Roadmap > smart-account model: move enforcement into the agent's own wallet via a
  > custom Soroban account contract (`__check_auth`), so the wallet itself won't sign a
  > transaction unless Watchdog's rules pass, no deposit step required, funds never leave
  > the agent's own custody."

Stellar Agent Guard **is** that model, built and proven: `__check_auth` enforcement,
non-custodial, no proxy wrappers, tested end-to-end on testnet.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is unaudited security tooling that gates real fund access. Do
> not deploy to mainnet without an independent audit. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Enforcement scope — read this before relying on the caps

Full recipient/amount enforcement — spend caps, allowlists, per-transaction limits — is native and automatic for SAC token transfers (`transfer`/`transfer_from`), since these are the calls whose arguments the Soroban auth context exposes for inspection. For other Soroban contract calls made by the guarded account (arbitrary DEX/lending/protocol calls), the policy engine still enforces window and pause state, but per-call amount/recipient limits are not yet enforced — extending fine-grained enforcement to arbitrary calls is tracked as a v2 item, not implied as already covered — full statement: [SPEC §2](SPEC.md#2-enforcement-scope--sac-token-calls-vs-every-other-soroban-call-required-framing). Elaborated with tables in [docs/enforcement-scope.md](docs/enforcement-scope.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the contract and run the test suite
git clone https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-contracts.git
cd stellar-agent-guard-contracts
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none   # → target/wasm32v1-none/release/stellar_agent_guard_contracts.wasm
cargo test                                      # 68 tests, isolated (no network)

# Read live state from the Phase-1 testnet deployment (no auth, simulation only)
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- status
# → {"admin_frozen":false,"has_policy":true,"heartbeat_expired":true,"last_heartbeat":1788855212,"now":1788863857}
```

## Public functions

All signatures below are pulled from the deployed source; the write-path examples were
re-verified this session by simulating each call against the live Phase-1 testnet
deployment (no transaction submitted). The Phase-1 fixture policy is
`per_tx_cap: 1000, window_cap: 150, window_secs: 60, assets: [token], recipients: [GDUYLF…],
dms_grace_secs: 60`.

### `initialize`
```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, agent_pubkey: BytesN<32>)
```
One-time setup, `require_auth(admin)`. Stores the policy `admin` and the agent's Ed25519
public key (32 bytes) in instance storage, and initializes `AdminFrozen = false`,
`LastHeartbeat = 0`. Until `set_policy` runs, the account is **default-deny** — every
authorization is rejected with `not_initialized`/`no_policy`.

Called twice, it fails with `AlreadyInitialized` — verified live:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- \
  initialize --admin GD5S5O2MZ6FSMFH6QILG37KSQNRVR3RPSWBTTV4JOUJ7J6TWLLL5LAVS \
  --agent_pubkey 1cb479acb9bb7d9b3a04a6865f5c44216f8a463d64ea7ceeb1447fee21cdcc05
# → ❌ transaction simulation failed: HostError: Error(Contract, #2)   (AlreadyInitialized)
```

> **Recovery: `AlreadyInitialized` is not a failure.** Deploy scripts that retry — a
> fee-bump double-submit or an operator panic-retry — hit `Error(Contract, #2)` on the
> second attempt when the **first** attempt actually succeeded. If you see it, do **not**
> redeploy a fresh guard (you would split your policy admin across two contracts): check
> `status()` first, and only if it reads sane (`has_policy: false`/`admin_frozen: false`,
> agent key as expected) proceed directly to the next step, `set_policy`. Redeploy only
> if `status()` shows the first attempt genuinely failed (nothing was ever initialized).

The Phase-1 deployment's real `initialize` transaction:
`cb17b7b1c65bff74b6bc99f67fe3cf1070c7a28f14bdd71527ba60c9d4a81264`.

### `set_policy`
```rust
pub fn set_policy(env: Env, config: PolicyConfig)
```
Admin-only (`require_auth(Admin)`). Replaces the policy, resets the rolling window, and
starts the dead-man-switch clock at install time (a fresh policy gets full grace). The
`PolicyConfig` fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `per_tx_cap` | `i128` | per asset-transfer call cap; `0` = disabled |
| `window_secs` | `u64` | rolling window width in seconds (default 86_400) |
| `window_cap` | `i128` | rolling cap within `window_secs`; `0` = disabled |
| `assets` | `Vec<Address>` | SAC token contracts whose transfers get parsed and enforced |
| `protocols` | `Vec<ProtocolRule>` | allowlisted non-asset contracts (`contract` + optional `fns: Option<Vec<Symbol>>`) |
| `recipients` | `Vec<Address>` | allowed SAC transfer destinations |
| `recipient_window_caps` | `Vec<RecipientCap>` | per-recipient rolling-window cap overrides; recipients not listed use the global `window_cap` |
| `blocked_recipients` | `Vec<Address>` | denied SAC transfer destinations; checked before the allowlist and `allow_any_recipient` |
| `allow_any_recipient` | `bool` | escape hatch: skip the recipient allowlist (caps still apply) |
| `active_from` / `active_until` | `u64` | active window (unix seconds); `0` = unrestricted |
| `paused` | `bool` | admin kill switch |
| `dms_grace_secs` | `u64` | dead-man grace in seconds; `0` = disabled |

Config is validated **before** anything is written; invalid config fails with
`InvalidConfig` and the policy is left unchanged (fail-closed). Verified live — the
fixture policy installs cleanly (emits `EventPolicySet`), and an invalid active window
(`active_until <= active_from`) is rejected with `Error(Contract, #4)`:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- set_policy --config '{
    "active_from": 0, "active_until": 0, "allow_any_recipient": false,
    "assets": ["CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7"],
    "dms_grace_secs": 60, "paused": false, "per_tx_cap": "1000",
    "protocols": [], "recipients": ["GDUYLFVFLVISVOM5FK5KTBA446VQQ7NBRRFMLNLKLISKL26LJGKUVRRX"],
    "window_cap": "150", "window_secs": 60 }'
# → Event: EventPolicySet (event_policy_set)
```
Other validation rules (SPEC §8): negative caps, `window_cap > 0` or a positive
`recipient_window_caps` entry with `window_secs == 0`, duplicate
assets/recipients/blocked_recipients/protocol contracts, duplicate recipients in
`recipient_window_caps`, a non-empty intersection between `recipients` and
`blocked_recipients`, more than 256 recipients, blocked recipients, or per-recipient
cap entries, empty per-protocol fn lists, or the self-address in
`assets`/`protocols`/`recipients`/`blocked_recipients` all fail with `InvalidConfig`.

**Not sure where to start?** Copy-paste presets for common operator personas —
day-trader agent, payments bot, watch-only + heartbeat, max security — each with
rationale, explicit "what it does NOT protect against", and unaudited/mainnet/DMS-grace
warnings, are in [`docs/policy-templates.md`](docs/policy-templates.md). A CI test
installs every preset documented there, so the examples stay valid.

### `revoke_policy`
```rust
pub fn revoke_policy(env: Env)
```
Admin-only. Removes the policy and the rolling window → the account is immediately
default-deny. Verified live (simulation): emits `EventPolicyRevoked`.

### `rotate_agent_key`
```rust
pub fn rotate_agent_key(env: Env, new_pubkey: BytesN<32>)
```
Admin-only. Re-binds the agent's Ed25519 public key. The admin never gains fund-moving
power — it can only replace the key the account will authenticate. Verified live
(simulation): emits `EventAgentRotated`.

Full operational runbook — scheduled rotation, suspected-leak ordering
(freeze → rotate → unfreeze), rollback, and the admin-key immutability
statement: [`docs/key-rotation.md`](docs/key-rotation.md).

### `heartbeat`
```rust
pub fn heartbeat(env: Env)
```
The only self-call the policy allows. A valid caller is the **registered agent key and
nothing else**: `heartbeat` does `require_auth` on the contract itself, so it routes
through `__check_auth`, which verifies the agent's Ed25519 signature over the auth
payload. It records `LastHeartbeat = now` and emits `EventHeartbeat`. A heartbeat arriving
after the grace window expired is rejected (`heartbeat_expired`) — silence cannot
self-revive; only the admin's `unfreeze` restores the account.

The `stellar` CLI cannot invoke it, because it cannot sign Soroban auth entries whose
address is a contract. Use the repo's submission helper instead:
```bash
cd tools/agent-tx && cargo build --release
./target/release/agent-tx heartbeat \
  --guard CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --agent-secret S...   # the registered agent's Ed25519 secret (AGENT_SECRET env also works)
```

For the full steady-state loop an agent must run (heartbeat cadence, per-transfer
pre-flight, blocked-reason handling, DMS stop conditions), see
[`examples/agent-loop.md`](examples/agent-loop.md).
The TypeScript equivalent is the SDK's
[agent-runtime guide issue](https://github.com/Stellar-Agent-Guard/stellar-agent-guard-sdk/issues/74).

#### Check a transfer without broadcasting

`agent-tx preflight` simulates a transfer against current ledger state and
never submits it. With the registered agent secret, the signed auth entry runs
the real `__check_auth`; an admitted transfer prints an estimated fee, while a
policy denial prints the `auth_checked` diagnostic reason. The estimate is
`minResourceFee + inclusion fee + guard-footprint fee allowance`; it is not a
guarantee of the eventual inclusion fee.

```bash
cd tools/agent-tx && cargo build --release
./target/release/agent-tx preflight \
  --guard CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --asset CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7 \
  --to GDUYLFVFLVISVOM5FK5KTBA446VQQ7NBRRFMLNLKLISKL26LJGKUVRRX \
  --amount 1100 --secret "$AGENT_SECRET"
# BLOCKED (pre-broadcast, enforced simulation)
# diagnostic event: auth_checked, blocked, per_tx_cap_exceeded
# broadcast: no
```

The example exceeds the fixture policy's `per_tx_cap: 1000`. Exit codes:
`0` means signed simulation admitted the call, `1` means signed simulation
blocked it, and `2` means the unsigned simulation was inconclusive. `--secret`
is optional (or supplied via `AGENT_SECRET`): without it the tool retrieves the
registered public key and estimates a fee, but cannot sign the custom-account
authorization, so it cannot establish whether `__check_auth` will admit the
transfer. See [`tools/agent-tx/README.md`](tools/agent-tx/README.md) for details.

### `freeze` / `unfreeze`
```rust
pub fn freeze(env: Env)      // admin only — sets AdminFrozen = true
pub fn unfreeze(env: Env)    // admin only — clears AdminFrozen, LastHeartbeat = now
```
`freeze` is the immediate admin kill switch (blocks even a live, heartbeating agent);
`unfreeze` is the admin's liveness attestation that revives a dead-man-frozen account.
Both are admin-only (`require_auth(Admin)`). Verified live (simulation): `freeze` emits
`EventFrozen`, `unfreeze` emits `EventUnfrozen`.

> ⚠️ **`unfreeze` re-arms the dead-man switch.** One call does two jobs: it clears
> `AdminFrozen` *and* sets `LastHeartbeat = now` on the admin's authority. If the DMS
> grace had already elapsed when you unfreeze, you have just silently restarted the
> liveness clock — the account will not self-freeze again until the grace lapses once
> more. The emitted `event_unfrozen` carries `rearmed_dms: bool` (`true` = the call
> changed `LastHeartbeat`, i.e. the clock was re-armed; `false` = it was already
> `now`) so telemetry and audits can surface exactly that side effect. See [SPEC §5](SPEC.md#5-dead-man-switch--precise-definition).

The real Phase-1 unfreeze — the DMS-reversal transaction verified on-chain (tx
`dd327d32b18bfc6cebdf6c956503fe5318e28f8a8bc86a88cb7ee42c5d46b5e5`):
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source guard_admin --send=yes -- unfreeze
# → ✅ Transaction submitted successfully!  tx=dd327d32b18bfc6cebdf6c956503fe5318e28f8a8bc86a88cb7ee42c5d46b5e5
```

### `policy` (read)
```rust
pub fn policy(env: Env) -> Option<PolicyConfig>
```
No auth. Returns the current policy, or `None` (default-deny). When submitted on-ledger, this
read may extend the policy TTL and incur rent if it is below the threshold in [SPEC §9.5](SPEC.md#95-persistent-storage-ttl-liveness);
simulation does not persist the extension. Verified live against the deployed contract — this is
the real installed fixture policy:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- policy
# → {"active_from":0,"active_until":0,"allow_any_recipient":false,
#    "assets":["CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7"],
#    "dms_grace_secs":60,"paused":false,"per_tx_cap":"1000","protocols":[],
#    "recipients":["GDUYLFVFLVISVOM5FK5KTBA446VQQ7NBRRFMLNLKLISKL26LJGKUVRRX"],
#    "window_cap":"150","window_secs":60}
```

### `policy_hash` (read) — cheap drift detection
```rust
pub fn policy_hash(env: Env) -> BytesN<32>
```
No auth. Returns the SHA-256 over the canonical (ScVal XDR)
encoding of the installed policy, so SDKs/dashboards can detect policy drift by comparing
one value instead of shipping and diffing the full `PolicyConfig`, and can record the hash
alongside `auth_checked` events as a tamper-evident log anchor. With no policy installed the
read returns the documented sentinel `NO_POLICY_DIGEST` = `sha256("")`
(`e3b0c442…b855`) — never a trap; `revoke_policy()` restores it. The encoding, field order,
and sentinel are pinned in [SPEC §7.3](SPEC.md#73-policy-hash--cheap-drift-detection-policy_hash)
and locked by `tests/policy_hash_encoding.rs`; off-chain, reproduce the hash by SHA-256-ing
the XDR bytes of the same policy value your SDK builds for `set_policy`.

### `status` (read)
```rust
pub fn status(env: Env) -> Status
```
No auth. Returns `{ has_policy, admin_frozen, heartbeat_expired, last_heartbeat, now }` plus
the additive operational fields `paused` (the policy's kill switch; `false` with no policy),
`window_remaining` (global `window_cap - spent` on the pruned ledger; `null` when the global
cap is disabled — mirrors `check_detailed`'s `remaining_window` for recipients without an
override), and `outside_active_window` (`now` outside the policy's `active_from`/`active_until`
bounds, both inclusive; `false` with no policy or an unrestricted window). When
submitted on-ledger, this read may extend persistent-entry TTLs and incur rent; simulation does
not persist those extensions (SPEC §9.5).
Verified live:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- status
# → {"admin_frozen":false,"has_policy":true,"heartbeat_expired":true,"last_heartbeat":1788855212,"now":1788863857}
```
Note the deployed account now reads `heartbeat_expired: true` — the 60s DMS grace lapsed
after the Phase-1 fixture runs, exactly as the design specifies: a silent account freezes
itself with zero transactions.

### `check` — Preflight / simulate a transfer (read, permissionless)
```rust
pub fn check(env: Env, asset: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) -> CheckResult
```
> **SDK discoverability alias:** `check` is the permissionless **preflight** /
> **simulate** entrypoint — search for "preflight", "simulate", or
> `simulate_transfer` to find this section. These are documentation aliases
> only: the on-chain ABI is frozen as `check` (and `check_detailed`); there is
> no `simulate_transfer` function to invoke.
No auth. A pre-flight replica of the SAC-transfer decision path: lets agents/SDKs simulate a
transfer *before* signing, emitting the same `auth_checked` events as an in-path decision so
telemetry sees one vocabulary. Submitting it on-ledger may extend persistent-entry TTLs and
incur rent (SPEC §9.5); simulation does not persist those extensions. Verified live (this account is
DMS-frozen, so the honest answer today is blocked):
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7 \
  --network testnet --source-account guard_admin --send=no -- \
  check --asset CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7 \
  --to GDUYLFVFLVISVOM5FK5KTBA446VQQ7NBRRFMLNLKLISKL26LJGKUVRRX --amount 50
# → {"Blocked":"heartbeat_expired"}
```

For operator triage, `check_detailed` returns the same verdict plus current headroom and
effective caps without changing spend accounting. A submitted call may extend persistent-entry
TTLs and incur rent (SPEC §9.5); simulation does not persist those extensions:
```rust
pub fn check_detailed(env: Env, asset: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) -> CheckDetail
```
Example CLI read for a policy with a 150-unit rolling cap and 40 units already spent:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id GUARD_CONTRACT_ID --network testnet --source-account operator --send=no -- \
  check_detailed --asset ASSET_CONTRACT_ID --to RECIPIENT_ADDRESS --amount 25
# → {"result":"Allowed","remaining_window":"110","per_tx_cap":"1000",\
#    "effective_per_tx_cap":"1000","effective_window_cap":"150"}
```
When a cap is disabled, its corresponding detail is `None` rather than a sentinel value.
The SDK and dashboard should consume these fields for pre-signing warnings and blocked-call
operator reports.

### `__check_auth` (host-invoked — not callable by anyone)
```rust
fn __check_auth(env: Env, signature_payload: Hash<32>, signatures: BytesN<64>,
                auth_contexts: Vec<Context>) -> Result<(), Error>
```
This is the enforcement entrypoint, and it is **not** a user-callable function: the Soroban
host invokes it automatically on every authorization the account must approve. Step by step:

1. Load the registered agent pubkey from instance storage — missing means
   `NotInitialized` (default-deny until `initialize`).
2. Verify the agent's Ed25519 signature over `signature_payload` via
   `env.crypto().ed25519_verify` — a wrong key or bad signature traps the frame before any
   policy evaluation.
3. Snapshot policy state: `PolicyConfig` (missing → `NoPolicy`), `AdminFrozen`,
   `LastHeartbeat`, ledger time.
4. Run the decision table (`decide`) — account-level gates first, then a per-context
   decision loop, then commit window admissions only if every context passed.
5. Return `Ok(())` to approve the transaction, or `Err(reason)` to reject it — and emit
   the `auth_checked` event either way.

See [How it works](#how-it-works) below for the full flow through `parse_call`/`decide`.

## Troubleshooting — Submission Errors

When submitting transactions via `agent-tx` (run `agent-tx --help` for usage and troubleshooting reference) or the RPC, submission failures are mapped to actionable operator guidance. Common submission error classes and their exact fixes:

| Error Class / Code | What Happened | Exact Flag / Remediation | SPEC Ref / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tx_insufficient_fee` / `insufficient` | The transaction inclusion fee or resource fee was lower than the network minimum or insufficient to cover the footprint. | Resubmit with a higher fee or use `--fee-multiplier <VAL>` (or bump resource fee / inclusion fee) to satisfy network pricing. | Stellar Core transaction pre-check |
| `tx_bad_seq` / `seq` | Sequence number collision or mismatch. The source account sequence has advanced or needs a refresh. | Fetch the latest account sequence from RPC (`agent-tx` fetches this automatically on run) and resubmit with the correct sequence. | Stellar Core sequence check |
| `tx_too_early` | Transaction precondition ledger bounds are not yet met (ledger time is before `min_ledger`). | Wait for the next ledger or check node time synchronization. | Preconditions check |
| `tx_late_expiration` | Transaction or signature expiration ledger has passed (`max_ledger` or `signature_expiration_ledger`). | Increase the signature expiration ledger delta (`--sig-expiration-ledgers <VAL>`) and resubmit. | Signature expiration check |

cargo fmt --check
```
Both builds and all three gates were re-run green on this machine during the README pass.

### Download a released artifact (instead of building)

Each tagged release (`v*`) publishes the contract WASM built by the
[`release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) — after the full gate
suite (format, clippy, tests) went green — together with a SHA-256 checksum,
a build-provenance file (git tag, commit SHA, toolchain version), and a
CycloneDX SBOM. Prefer this over a local build when you want the exact bytes
CI blessed:

```bash
VERSION=v0.1.0  # pick a release from the Releases page
REPO=aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-contracts
curl -sSL -O https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/$VERSION/stellar_agent_guard_contracts.wasm
curl -sSL -O https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/$VERSION/stellar_agent_guard_contracts.wasm.sha256
sha256sum -c stellar_agent_guard_contracts.wasm.sha256
# → stellar_agent_guard_contracts.wasm: OK
```

Then cross-check `provenance.txt` from the same release (it pins the git tag
and commit the WASM was built from — rebuild that tag yourself and compare
hashes for a reproducibility check) and `sbom.cdx.json` for the dependency
inventory. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full verification steps.

Walkthrough, matching the real code path in `src/lib.rs` / `src/engine.rs`:

1. **Signature verification.** `__check_auth` loads the registered agent pubkey and calls
   `env.crypto().ed25519_verify` over the transaction auth payload. This runs before any
   policy logic, so a compromised-but-unregistered key never reaches the decision table.
2. **Policy snapshot.** The current `PolicyConfig`, `AdminFrozen`, `LastHeartbeat`, and
   ledger time are loaded. No policy stored ⇒ `NoPolicy` — the account is default-deny.
3. **Account-level gates** (in this order): admin freeze, dead-man switch (grace elapsed
   since last heartbeat), pause, active window. Any one firing rejects the transaction
   regardless of what the call is.
4. **Per-context classification.** `parse_call` turns each `Context` into a typed call:
   `SelfCall` (only `heartbeat` is allowed), `CreateContract` (denied in v1),
   `Unknown`/`AssetOther` (denied), `AssetTransfer` (a known SAC transfer with parsed
   recipient and amount), or `Protocol` (a call to an allowlisted contract).
5. **Per-kind enforcement.** Asset transfers get the full treatment — recipient
   denylist (checked before the allowlist and before `allow_any_recipient`), recipient
   allowlist, per-tx cap, and the rolling-window projection (existing total + amounts
   staged earlier in the same request). Protocol calls get contract + per-function
   allowlisting. Everything else is denied by default.
6. **All-or-nothing commit.** Window admissions are staged and only committed to storage
   if *every* context passes — a partially-validating batch can never spend. `Ok(())`
   approves; `Err(reason)` rejects the entire transaction, and the `auth_checked` event
   records the outcome either way.

## Storage

On-chain state, keyed per the `DataKey` enum in `src/types.rs` (SPEC §3):

| Key | Type | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Initialized` | `bool` | instance | one-time flag for `initialize` |
| `Admin` | `Address` | instance | policy admin; set once at `initialize` |
| `AgentPubkey` | `BytesN<32>` | instance | the registered agent's Ed25519 public key |
| `Policy` | `PolicyConfig` | persistent | current policy (`None` = default-deny) |
| `Window` | `WindowState` | persistent | rolling spend ledger (`total` + chronological `entries`) |
| `LastHeartbeat` | `u64` | persistent | unix seconds of the last agent heartbeat (`0` = never) |
| `AdminFrozen` | `bool` | persistent | admin-initiated freeze flag |

Instance keys auto-refresh TTL on every invocation; persistent keys are extended to the
maximum TTL on writes and refreshed to maximum when a read finds less than half the maximum
TTL remaining (`persist_get`; SPEC §9.5). The `Window` ledger is bounded at
`MAX_WINDOW_ENTRIES = 8192` — beyond that, the two oldest entries merge *forward*
(conservative over-count), so the `window_cap` ceiling is never exceeded (SPEC §3.1).
See [Storage rent and TTL cost model](docs/rent-and-ttl.md) for approximate XLM costs,
who pays extension rent, and the underfunded-expiry failure mode.

## Architecture

Stellar Agent Guard operates across three dedicated repositories:

## Repository layout

- `src/` — contract: `__check_auth` (CustomAccount), policy engine, rolling window,
  dead-man switch, admin controls, events.
- `src/integration_tests.rs` — contract-level tests that exercise the real
  `__check_auth` path, including Ed25519 auth-signature verification (SPEC §11).
- `tools/agent-tx/` — submission helper that signs Soroban auth entries for the guard
  (custom-account) address and submits real testnet transactions. The `stellar` CLI
  cannot sign auth entries whose address is a contract, so this tool fills that gap; it
  is the prototype of the Phase 2 SDK's signing path.
- `examples/agent-loop.md` — the steady-state **24/7 agent runtime loop**: heartbeat
  cadence formula (`interval ≤ grace / 3`), pre-flight `check()`, blocked-reason
  handling table, and stop conditions, with tested `agent-tx` commands.
- `docs/policy-templates.md` — copy-paste **policy presets** for common operator
  personas (day-trader, payments bot, watch-only, max security), each with rationale
  and explicit "what it does NOT protect against"; kept installable by
  `src/policy_preset_tests.rs`, which installs every preset via `set_policy` in CI.
- `tests/fixtures/README.md` — the real testnet evidence for the five scenarios,
  with a machine-readable scenario index in
  [`tests/fixtures/index.json`](tests/fixtures/index.json) (scenario → tx hash →
  ledger → expected reason → contract ID) that CI keeps consistent with the prose.
- `SPEC.md` — the full architecture specification.

## ✅ Verified against live testnet

Phase 1 was proven end-to-end against a **real deployed contract** on Stellar testnet
(protocol 28, `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`), cross-checked on-chain:

- **Guard (custom account) contract ID**:
  `CAYJZT4XH5SWDXNR7MZJCCUBIDAT2KZDDUTZ7OZQEMKCPJGD4P3X4CU7`
- **SAC token**: `CBLQLJAG72M4XQRJMQHSKYIFVHQD7LNTNOQH2GRMCMBWMSLBSLTGTJC7`
- **Allowed transfer** (scenario 1), ledger 4566285, `successful: true`:
  `4c5759298c0364b01d386a5935b964532b04978ea595d96d904d9011f58d64b8`
- **Post-unfreeze transfer** (scenario 5 reversal), ledger 4566327:
  `b39457afa59f20d6ac90cd137e917c7efd51e27af4913c6c6308a6e5d0eff512`
- **Admin unfreeze** (DMS reversal):
  `dd327d32b18bfc6cebdf6c956503fe5318e28f8a8bc86a88cb7ee42c5d46b5e5`

The five scenarios — allowed transfer, per-tx cap block, rolling-window cap block,
recipient-allowlist block, and dead-man trigger + reversal — plus the setup transaction
hashes, the event output from the contract's own `auth_checked` topics, and full
reproduction steps live in
[`tests/fixtures/README.md`](tests/fixtures/README.md). During this README pass the
deployed contract's `status`/`policy`/`check` functions were invoked live again (results
pasted in the function reference above) — the account is still on-chain and readable,
and honestly reports the DMS has since expired, exactly as designed.

## Project Status

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Custom-account `__check_auth` enforcement | ✅ |
| Per-transaction spend cap | ✅ |
| Rolling window spend cap | ✅ |
| Recipient allowlist (SAC transfers) | ✅ |
| Recipient denylist / blocklist (SAC transfers) | ✅ |
| Protocol/function allowlist (any call) | ✅ |
| Dead-man switch (freeze on missed heartbeat) | ✅ |
| Admin unfreeze | ✅ |
| Verified against live testnet (cross-checked) | ✅ |
| Fine-grained amount/recipient enforcement for non-SAC calls | 🔲 (v2, tracked as [issue #1](https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-contracts/issues/1)) |

## Testing & CI

68 tests (unit + integration) cover the policy decision engine — including the regression
for the rolling-window prune underflow at low timestamps, the per-tx-cap arithmetic that
proves blocked transactions never consume the window, and dead-man-switch timeline edge
cases — plus `__check_auth` Ed25519 signature verification and the full enforcement
scenario matrix (SPEC §11). Verified green this session: `68 passed; 0 failed`.

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features   # clippy `all` + `pedantic` denied via Cargo.toml lints
cargo fmt --check
```

Every push runs these gates on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job `ci`):
format → clippy (`-D warnings`) → unit + integration tests → contract wasm build →
`agent-tx` build. `main` is protected by a branch ruleset — the `ci` check must be green
and a review approved for changes to merge.
